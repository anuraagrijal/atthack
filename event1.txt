Hello Everyone,

Come to the first TRUST event of the semester and find out how you can better sell yourself to companies! Tomorrow, Wednesday, September 17th at 6:30 in the LKD building Reading Room, Room 2019. 

Ms. King can you please forward this out to everyone.

Thanks!


Hello everyone!

I hope you all enjoyed your weeks, and for those of you that had midterms, I hope that you did well on them. For those of us that still have midterms coming up, good luck to us!

Two things:

> First, if you haven't already registered for the AT&T Women In Tech Hackathon tonight, I encourage you to do so! It's totally free, there will be FREE FOOD, and opportunities to network and to build fun apps and such. It's right in Downing Hall, so just come out anyway. Registration closes at 5:00 pm today, so click here to register.

> There is an opportunity for you guys to make some money mentoring middle school students. Great Minds in STEM, a non-profit organization, is giving $100 to everyone who comes to help lead teams of middle school students through a series of mini-competitions. The event is Friday, October 17 from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm, and they are in need of 25 engineering majors to serve as College Captains for the competition. If you're interested, please register here.

I hope to see you guys attending at least one of these events. Enjoy the long weekend and I'll see you at homecoming!
